# Linear-Search
## Aim - Write a program to implement linear search.
### Description - Linear search is a very basic and simple search algorithm. In Linear search, we search an element or value in a given array by traversing the array from the starting, till the desired element or value is found. It compares the element to be searched with all the elements present in the array and when the element is matched successfully, then result will be showed as "Number is present".
